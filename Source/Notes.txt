Azure Storage Emulator: Process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process
netstat -p tcp -ano | findstr :10000
tasklist /fi "pid eq ????"

========================

To Do:
 - Fold XML logic into objects and not hard coded strings.
 - Push formatting of "filter" parameters into objects.
 - Deal with custom domains for accounts.
 - Examples of "filters" in XML comments.
 - Add in log4net for diagnostics.
 - Note that Azure is throttled, perhaps causes issues when running tests.
 - Some sort of pluggable policy for handling different HTTP error codes e.g. 502 Bad Gateway (would be the proxy).
 - Some way of automatically throtting the requests to Azure to prevent errors.

Done
 - Argument validation.
 - Select HTTPS or not for endpoints.
